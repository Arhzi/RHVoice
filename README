                         RHVoice version 0.1

RHVoice is a Russian speech synthesizer.
It uses the following free software components:
* Russian speech database and Russian language description for
  Festival by Nickolay V. Shmyrev (https://developer.berlios.de/projects/festlang)
  The phoneset and almost all of the main lts rules are used as is,
  but I've made changes in other parts, either to simplify conversion
  to the flite format, or to add new features, or just to understand
  how it all works.
* The voice has been trained with The HMM-based Speech Synthesis
  System (HTS) (http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp)
* The hts_engine API is used for runtime speech generation
  (http://hts-engine.sourceforge.net/)
  Since the library does not support streaming synthesis, the original
  version has been modified to implement this functionality, and the
  synthesizer distribution includes this patched version.
* The C implementation of the Russian text analyzer uses Flite
  (http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite)
  I used the flite's implementation of English language support as an
  example, some functions were used as a starting point.
* the stress information for the stress dictionary has been extracted
  from the test dictionary in the RuLex package by Igor B. Poretsky
  (http://poretsky.homelinux.net/packages/)
* GNU libunistring is used for working with unicode text
  (http://www.gnu.org/software/libunistring/)

                               Building
Requirements:
* A C compiler
* SCons build system (http://www.scons.org/)
* Python (http://www.python.org/)
* Flite 1.4 or later
* GNU libunistring
To compile the package type 'scons'. Then type 'scons install'. If you
want to change the installation prefix, then the first command should
be 'scons prefix=<path>'. Type 'scons -h' for help.

                              How to use
Run 'RHVoice --help' to see the supported command line options.
If you want to configure Voiceman tu use RHVoice for Russian output,
you should add a new output section in voiceman.conf. Here's an
example:

[output]
name = RHVoice
type = command
lang = rus
synth command = "RHVoice -r %r -p %p"
alsa player command = "play -"
pitch num digits after dot = 2
pitch min = "0.1"
pitch aver = 1
pitch max = "1.9"
rate num digits after dot = 2
rate min = "0.5"
rate aver = 1
rate max = 3
