Building
Requirements:
* A C compiler
* SCons build system (http://www.scons.org/)
* Python (http://www.python.org/)
* Flite 1.4 or later
* GNU libunistring
To compile the package type 'scons'. Then type 'scons install'. If you
want to change the installation prefix, then the first command should
be 'scons prefix=<path>'. Type 'scons -h' for help.

                              How to use
Run 'RHVoice --help' to see the supported command line options.
If you want to configure Voiceman tu use RHVoice for Russian output,
you should add a new output section in voiceman.conf. Here's an
example:

[output]
name = RHVoice
type = command
lang = rus
synth command = "RHVoice -r %r -p %p"
alsa player command = "play -"
pitch num digits after dot = 2
pitch min = "0.1"
pitch aver = 1
pitch max = "1.9"
rate num digits after dot = 2
rate min = "0.5"
rate aver = 1
rate max = 3
